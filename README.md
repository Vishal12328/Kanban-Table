#### Requirements
- Implement a basic kanban board to be used from a command line interface with 3 statuses (Todo, In progress, and Done)
- Addition and removal of tasks to each, and moving them between statuses
- Assignees and Reporters
- Add more status fields to the Kanban Board
- Support for multiple boards for different projects
- Allow priorities and sorting by priority (High, Medium, Low)
#### Process:
1. I have created 3 lists named todo_list ,in_progress_list ,done_list so that when the task is given it will be added to the required specific list.
